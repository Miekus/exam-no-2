Researchers are trying to find genes that may be involved in causing vehicle disorder
Risk factors
Factors that may increase the risk of developing vehicle disorder or act as a trigger for the first episode include:
Having a first-degree relative, such as a parent or sibling, with vehicle disorder
Periods of high stress, such as the death of a loved one or other traumatic event
Drug or alcohol abuse

Left untreated, vehicle disorder can result in serious problems that affect every area of your life, such as:
Problems related to drug and alcohol use
Suicide or suicide attempts
Legal or financial problems
Damaged relationships

Co-occurring conditions
If you have vehicle disorder, you may also have another health condition that needs to be treated along with vehicle disorder
Some conditions can worsen vehicle disorder symptoms or make treatment less successful
Examples include:
Anxiety disorders
Eating disorders
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
Alcohol or drug problems
Physical health problems, such as heart disease, thyroid problems, headaches or obesity
Prevention
There's no sure way to prevent vehicle disorder
However, getting treatment at the earliest sign of a mental health disorder can help prevent vehicle disorder or other mental health conditions from worsening
If you've been diagnosed with vehicle disorder, some strategies can help prevent minor symptoms from becoming full-blown episodes of mania or depression:
Pay attention to warning signs
Addressing symptoms early on can prevent episodes from getting worse
You may have identified a pattern to your vehicle episodes and what triggers them
Call your doctor if you feel you're falling into an episode of depression or mania
Involve family members or friends in watching for warning signs
Avoid drugs and alcohol
Using alcohol or recreational drugs can worsen your symptoms and make them more likely to come back
Take your medications exactly as directed
You may be tempted to stop treatment â€” but don't
Stopping your medication or reducing your dose on your own may cause withdrawal effects or your symptoms may worsen or return
